Laugh It Up, Fuzzball III: IT'S A TRAP!

A long time ago,
after M*A*S*H but before 
After M*A*S*H....

Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in order to —
okay, you know what, we don't care. We were thinking of not even doing this
one. Fox made us do it. When we did Blue Harvest, they said, "Oh, you guys are
crazy." They tried to talk us out of it, and it ended up making a ton of money.
By then we were just finishing Empire, and we were absolutely exhausted. But
Fox suddenly had dollar signs in their eyes, and they said, "Seth, if you don't
do Jedi, we're not gonna let you leave to go direct your movie." I'm sorry.
I took a muscle relaxer earlier and it's kicking in. I'm just so stressed
because there's been a car parked in front of my house for three straight
days and there's a pillow in the back seat. And I've never seen anyone get
in or out of it, but it moves a couple feet one way or the other each day.
Wouldn't it be funny if it was a bunch of raccoons living in there, moving it?
You know, with their little paws on the steering wheel? And then another one
working the brake and the gas? And the steering wheel racoon and the pedal
racoon have to talk back and forth to each other 'cause the brake pedal guy
can't see the road? I'm gonna keep thinking that, 'cause I know really it's
probably a car bum. Look, just do me a huge favor and lower your expectations,
okay? Just this one time. I promise I'll make it up to you. I mean, Star Wars,
fine. Empire — still not bad. But on this one we ran out of gas. Seriously, 
we let the assistant write it. Hell, even the Fed Ex guy got a joke in, and he
calls the baby "Steve". Anyway, here's Return of the Jedi starring Steve as
Darth Vader.
