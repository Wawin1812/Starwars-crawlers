Laugh It Up, Fuzzball II: SOMETHING, SOMETHING, SOMETHING DARK SIDE

A long time ago,
when the gays 
weren't all in your 
face about it....

It is a dark time for the
Rebellion. Although the Death
Star has been destroyed,
Imperial troops have driven the
Rebel forces from their hidden
base and pursued them across
the galaxy. But you
know this story.

What you may not know is
that 20th Century Fox had
so little faith in the "Star
Wars" franchise that they 
let George Lucas keep all
the merchandising rights.

Are   you   listening,
stockholders? How can you
invest in a company that
makes such short-sighted
decisions? I mean, this is
the same company that
canceled "Family Guy" twice.
Who's running that joint?
Monkeys? I mean, if they're 
gonna be that foolish with
their money, then I guess
that means we can be 
foolish with their money,
too. Like spending a
bunch of it to animate
a computer-generated
cartoon elephant that has
nothing to do with the rest
of the episode.

Did you see that? Know 
what that cost? $58,000.
I mean, what a waste. It
wasn't even that funny.
That's $58,000 that could 
have gone to curing
leukemia. Or muscular
dystrophy. Or... what does
Michael J. Fox have? That.
Alright, let's watch some
goddamn cartoons.
