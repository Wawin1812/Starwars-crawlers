Laugh It Up, Fuzzball I: THE BLUE HARVEST

A long time ago...
but somehow in the future....

It is a time of civil war, and renegade paragraphs floating through space.
There's cool space battles, and the bad guy is the good guy's dad, but you
don't find that out 'til the next episode. And the hot chick is really the
sister of the good guy, but they don't know it, and they kiss. Which is kind
of messed up. I mean, what if they had done it instead of just kissed? Angelina
Jolie kissed her brother. Yeah, she did. You know it, I know it, and her dad
knows it. That's why they hardly ever talk anymore. You can run away to Africa,
but you can't run away from the truth. Oh, by the way, here's a tip for you:
when this is over, go out and rent the movie "Gia." She's way naked in it, and
makes out with another chick and everything. It's awesome. I stumbled across it
late at night on HBO after I had just got back from hockey and I almost 
fainted. But I digest... Princess Leia was coming back from buying space
groceries when this happened...
